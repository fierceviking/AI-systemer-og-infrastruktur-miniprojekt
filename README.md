# Miniproject in AI-systems and infrastructure
## EDA
The EDA has been seperated into the folders "Line plots", "Pie charts", and "Pivot tables". Files in these folders can be run as-is as the csv-files have been premade using the feature_engineering script in the deployment folder.

## Deployment
To deploy the system locally, a Dockerfile has been provided which can be built by running run.py in deployment and using Docker Desktop. 

## Code inspiration
Line 26 to 39 in "Line plots/line_plots.py" were provided by our lecturer, Haomin Yu, and are included here with permission.

### The following files have taken inspiration from "Engineering MLOps: Rapidly build, test, and manage production-ready machine learning life cycles at scale"
The file "Dockerfile" has taken inspiration from page 206 and 207, but we have modified the code.
The file "app.py" has taken inspiration from page 204, but we have heavily modified the code.
